# Cat-Quest
I wrote the code for this game entirely from scratch, with a kickstart from Lazyfoo's SDL2 tutorial so I could figure out how that worked.

This was started in class, and (I plan to) finish it with more levels, features, and smoother gameplay in the future. 

It is a simple platformer game, similar to Mario. It scrolls horizontally or vertically, and you must jump on enemies and avoid spikes and pits to get to the flower.
